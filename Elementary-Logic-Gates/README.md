# Module 1: Elementary Logic Gates
* A typical computer architecture is based on a set of elementary logic gates like And, Or, Mux, etc., as well as on their bitwise versions And16, Or16, Mux16, etc. (assuming a 16-bit machine).
* In this module ta will build a typical set of basic logic gates. These gates form the elementary building blocks from which you will build the computerâ€™s CPU and RAM chips in later projects.
